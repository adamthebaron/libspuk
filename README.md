libspuk
=======

Simple library that contains type definitions and functions useful for downloading files.

libspuk is merely some code that uses the UNIX TCP/IP stack to access files on the Internet. It uses sockets exensively,
and creates structures based around sockets. It's primary use is for me, so that I may have an easier time writing spuk
(its relevant program. Think of the two as libcurl and curl), however anyone can use the code.

Is there actually any C++?
==========================

Uh, no. Github is weird and I really need to switch to my own servers. But theres this thing where I have no money.
I could talk to you about that, but I have to listen to Pandora.
