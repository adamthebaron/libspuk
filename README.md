libspuk (No longer working on this.)
=======

Simple library that contains type definitions and functions useful for downloading files.

libspuk is merely some code that uses the UNIX TCP/IP stack to access files on the Internet. It uses sockets exensively,
and creates structures based around sockets. It's primary use is for me, so that I may have an easier time writing spuk
(its relevant program. Think of the two as libcurl and curl), however anyone can use the code.
